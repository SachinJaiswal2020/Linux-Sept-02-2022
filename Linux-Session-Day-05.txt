======================== Quick Recap =======================================
Phase-01:-
1. Introduction to Enterprise Linux, and basic understanding/usages of Linux OS.
2. Editor understanding (vim).
3. User/Group management.
4. Linux Permission model.


### Concepts - Installation of Enterprise Linux (EL) on system (Physical/Virtual).
  
Physical machine - Laptop/Dell-PowerEdge servers/ HP GEN X / IBM Power/SOme model Blade server/etc.
Virtual Machine  - Virtual machines serve same applications as physical machines.
NOte: ***
 - Virtual machine installed on hypervisor (Hypervisor - It's OS which allow to create Virtual machine).
 - Those virtual machine having guest operating systems, later DB or middleware installed on OS and run the application.
 - Hypervisor (3rd part based software) - which allow to create VIrtual machine.
 - Hypervisor used here is - "Oracle Virtual Box" ( INstalled this on your system).
 - We have used CentOS 7.9 with x86_64 arch and build the OS, Also we have mounted the same ISO on your system (For the purpose - package management).
 - We have used GNOME (GUI interface) and bash (CLI Interface).
 
 - Hypervisor used here is - "Oracle Virtual Box" and it allow to add additional hardwares (Network Interface Card "NIC", hard disk, Increase RAM/CPU etc - Complate management of your Virtual machine can be easily done. 
 
##
 - Basic Linux commands and FOSS (Free OpenSource Software).
 - OpenSource - Source code and software must be available for all.
 - Basic command concepts:-
   # command option argument 
   Command - It is a utility, which can be used to perform some actions/events.
   OPtion - Option is/are required for modify the behavious/function of the command.
   Argument(s) - This is/are data which is required to execute the command.
   
##
2. Editor understanding (vim).
vim file_name
press "i" key - insert mode 

Type your 1st line.
Type your 2nd line.
Type your 3rd line.
Continue as per your task.

press "esc" key - Lock mode.

press ":wq" or ":wq!" or ":q" or ":q!" or ":w"

   w - write 
   q - quit
   - - nothong 
   
   
  # vimtutor
  Not: vimtutor is an application which gives you option to edit/update/create-new-file/delete the file's lines.
  - vimtutor (If you want to come out from "vimtutor" then same way need to come out as file).
     Press :wq
	 here not saving anything so :q 
	 Search part - press /"search_string" then enter.
	 Press "n" for next search and continu
	 Press "N" privious search and continu.
	 Press "g" to come to top line.
	 press "G" to go the the last line.
	 
	 
	 # Command option argument 
      - command having manual pages.
	    man 1 basic_command (basic_command - /bin or /usr/bin).
		Eg:
		man 1 mkdir 
		
		
		man 8 admin_related_command (sbin_command - /sbin or /usr/sbin).
		Eg:
		man 8 useradd 
		
	    man 5 file_name 
		Eg:
		man 5 passwd  (/etc/passwd).
		Eg: 
		 man 5 passwd or man 5 shadow 
		
	 Search part - press /"search_string" then enter.
	 Press "n" for next search and continu
	 Press "N" privious search and continu.
	 Press "g" to come to top line.
	 press "G" to go the the last line.
	 

    
 - User & Group management:-
   
  #Users:-
   Create user - useradd 
   Delete user - userdel 
   Modify user - usermod
   
   useradd <user_name> 
   Eg:
   useradd john 
   useradd tom 
   
  
  #Groups:-
   Create group - groupadd 
   Delete group - groupdel 
   modify group - groupmod   
   
  #groupadd <group_name>
	Eg:
	  groupadd unix_team
 
  #passwd (Set password for users).
   passwd <user_name>(as root user).
   passwd john 
   Type:
   retype:    
   
   group = unix_team
   useradd -g <primary_group_name> <user_name>
   Eg:
     useradd -g unix_team john  (unix_team is a primary group of john)
	 usermod -G unix_team tom   (unix_team is a secoundry group of yom).
	 
	 
	 ###########
	 1) groupadd 
	 2) groupdel
	 3) groupmod 
	 4) useradd 
	 5) usermod 
	 6) userdel 
	 7) passwd (echo "password@123"  | passwd --stdin user_name )
	    Example echo "password@123"  | passwd --stdin john
     8) chmod 
	 9) chown 
	 files:-
	 /etc/passwd     (man 5 passwd)
	 /etc/group      (man 5 group)
	 /etc/shadow     (man 5 shadow)
	 /etc/login.def  (man 5 login.def)
	 
	 ###########
	 Recap-Lab-01:-
	 
	 1) Group creation:-
         unix_grp with GID=4067
         middleware_grp with GID=4167
		 dba_grp with GID=4267
		 wintel_grp with GID=4367 
		 app1_grp with GID=4467

		 
	 2) user_name1/25  (25 user need to be created as per request, below all user's group as primary).
	    - user_name1 to user_name5 - unix_grp , UID=12345  ,comment=" Unix Team" 
	    - user_name6 to user_name10 - middleware_grp   , UID=11345 , command ="middleware User"
	    - user_name11 to user_name15 - wintel_grp  , UID=11445, command ="Wintel User"
	    - user_name16 to user_name10 - appl_grp , UID=11545, comment ="app1 User"
		
	 3) Below directory structure.
	 
	   /PROJETC_ORG
	       UNIX      grp_owner= unix_grp  (like this.)
		   MIDDLEWARE
		   WINTEL 
		   DBA 
		   APP1
		   
	 4) Set the permission and ownership/group-ownership 
		   chmod 770 - all the directory  
		   chown root:unix_grp  UNIX
     5) Create "project_grp" group and add all 25 users.
        Set the permission on project dir and it's sub directories "/Project" - (chmod 770
