Phase-01:-
1. Introduction to Enterprise Linux, and basic understanding/usages of Linux OS.

3. User/Group management.
4. Linux Permission model.


Point-01.
Introduction to Enterprise Linux, and basic understanding/usages of Linux OS.
What is Linux ?
- Linux is an Operating System, and It's a interface between software and hardware.

WHat is Operating System?
- Operating Systen is a software which manage the hardware.
  To achive the optimum utilization of hardware.

What is Linux Vs Enterprise Linux?
- Enterprise Linux (product) having SLO and SLA, which required for business.
- Linux is a community productcoming under (OpenSource), community not having any SLO and SLA.
- OpenSource mean - SOftware and source code must be available for all and for any purpose.

Many Linux distributions:-
 - RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) - Enterprise Linux     
 - CentOS 
 - Fedora 
 - Ubuntu 
 - Open SUSE 
 - Enterprise SUSE     - Enterprise Linux 
 - Kali Linux 
 
What is UNIX Vs Linux ? Due to GNU projecy (GNU NOT UNIX project - To create UNIX type OS.).
Linux OS = UNIX utility + Linux krernel 

######### 
1) Users
2) Shell - Interface (GUI & CLI).
3) Kernel 
4) Hardware (IBM blade server/Cisco servers etc 



1) Users (Administratier =root account, Each using havin User ID, root user's ID is 0)
2) Normal User (User created by root user for some work).
  NOte: Normal user can also have power same as root user having.
  
3) System users (apache, tcpdump etc):- When application deployed.


################

Absolute path  - It always start with "/".
Relative path  - It never start with "/".

Note: To get the absolute path - 
$ which pwd
/usr/bin/pwd 

Same also available here.
/bin/pwd 


########
## The file system Hierarchy 

Level 1st Directory hierarchy:-
"/"   - root directory 

Level 2nd directory hierarchy:-
"bin"  (Absolute location - /bin ) - ALl normal user's executable are placed inside "/bin" - Those are called command.
"boot" (Absolute location - /boot) - All booting related files and dir here.
"dev"  (Absolute location - /dev - All device files must be available at "dev" dir. 
"etc"  (Absolute location - /etc  - THe main configuration file here.
"home" (Absolute location - /home - ALl defauls user's home directory must be here.
"root" (Absolute location - /root - root user's home directory must be here.
"run"  (Absolute location - /run  - ALl run time data placed in "/run", it's temp).
"sbin" (Absolute location - /sbin ) - ALl normal root/sudo user's executable are placed inside "/sbin" - Those are called command.
"tmp"  (Absolute location - /tmp ) - ALl temp files/dir created here.

        NOte: If /tmp used almost 100% then any appliaction running and referencing "/tmp" will not work.
"usr"  (Absolute location - /usr) - This directory for easy customization.
       Eg:- /usr/local/bin/myscript
	        /usr/bin/tree
			/usr/sbin/useradd
"var"  -( Absolute location /v arr)   "Variable data (/var)".


#########################
Installation of OS (CentOS 7.9)

#######
Step-01 ) Download Oracle virtual box (3rd party software - same as hypervisor, which allow to create virtual machine).

Link given below.
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads


NOte: *** 
- What is hypervisor ?
Explained:- Hypervisor is an Operating System (OS) which allow to create Virtual machine (over the guest os "operating system, we can install other OS like Linux/Windows).

- System must be supported for Virtualization Technology (VT - Must be enabled).
Once Oracle Virtual Box manager installed thne load the operating system.




#######
Step-02) DOwnload CentOS 7.9 images.
http://centos.excellmedia.net/7.9.2009/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-2009.iso

  
#######
Step-03) Once download completed then open your "Oracle virtual Box Manager".
Once "Oracle virtual Box Manager" started --> Click on new  --> Name of the virtual machine "server-01/02"  --> "Name and operating system" - Input from your side (Linux and x86_64 "version64-bits") then click on "Next" --> provide RAM "3076" inside box - 3076, Select "Create Virtual Disk now" --> VHD (Viryal Hard Disk) and click on "Next".
Storage 25Gb and click on "create" 

then start your virtual machine and follow the installation step.

NOte: Virtual machine has been created.
---------------------------------------------
#######
Step-04) 
- Open "Oracle Virtual Box Manager" then right click and start your Virtual machine (VM).
- Load your VM via ISO (OS image - centos7.9.iso).
- Select "Operating System and ENter for installation".
- Disk partition.

 1st partition - /boot  partition_type=primary fs_type=ext4  size=512       (Default in MB)
 2nd partition - swap   partition_type=LVM     fs_type=ext4     size=2048   (Default in MB)
 3rd partition - /      partition_type=LVM     fs_type=ext4     size=20480  (Default in MB)
 
root/redhat 
Create one account (labuser) then setup the password.

Note: Set "redhat" as a connect password.


================== 
Atleast 4-8GB RAM for single VM machine required.
4 Minimum CPU required 
25-35GB Storage device required.

## COmmand Option Argumment 

Command  - Command is a ulitity to take some action.
OPtion   - OPtion modified the function of the command. (MOre functional now).
Argument - Argument is data  to execute the command.

Basic commands:-
whoami 
pwd
logname 
ls -l

=================================================================
Linux Session - Day-02 (03-Sept-2022):-
=========

Point-01 - 
Once installation completed (RHEL/CentOS7.9 on Oracle Virtual Box) then login to yout system as root.
Note: ***
- "root" acount password you have provided at the time of installation.
- Set all password "redhat" only.
- Make sure you should install linux with option "Server with GUI", by default it's "minimul" installation.


Point-02 - 
Click on "Activity" and open terminal (gnome-terminal - shell).
Terminal interface with "#" option.

localhost# mkdir work 




- Basic concepts of command/option/arguments.


- How to create folder - using command "mkdir" 

  Example (with no options)
# mkdir work 
# mkdir work1 work2
# mkdir project-01-data project-02-data


- HOw to create file(s) - using command "touch" - it will create empty file.
  Note: We can create multiple empty files.
  Examples:-
  # touch file1.txt
  # touch file2.txt file2.txt file3.txt 
  
- HOw to create file using editor (vim).
#vim file_name
press key "i" - for insert mode 

This is my 1st line.
This is my 2nd line. 
Continue 

press key "esc" - For lock screen
press :wq    or :w  or :q or :wq!

w - write 
q - Quite 
! - Forcelly 

==== Lab Exercise-01
- Login as root user and open terminal.
- Create directory/folder and files as mentioned beow
# mkdir work 
# cd work     (To go inside work use "cd command"
# Create 4 temp files and two directories.
file1.txt 
file2.txt
file3.txt 
file4.txt

dir1 
dir2 

vim myfile  

==================
-  Verify the contents.

This is my 1st line.
This is my 2nd line. 
Continue

passwd:       (Root password - "redhat") and press enter key.

# whoami 
root 
##############

cd - command used for change directory "change dir".

# mkdir work   (last time already created).
It's already already available
# pwd
/root 
# cd work 
# pwd
/root/work
# cd ../..   (two steps back)
#pwd
/
#cd /root/work/dir2 
#pwd
/root/work/dir2 
# cd ../../../
# pwd

# cp file1.txt dir1 
# ls -l dir1 
Note: File has been copied.
# mkdir dir3
