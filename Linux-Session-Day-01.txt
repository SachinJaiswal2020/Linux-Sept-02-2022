Phase-01:-

Point-01.
Introduction to Enterprise Linux, and basic understanding/usages of Linux OS.
What is Linux ?
- Linux is an Operating System, and It's a interface between software and hardware.

WHat is Operating System?
- Operating Systen is a software which manage the hardware.
  To achive the optimum utilization of hardware.

What is Linux Vs Enterprise Linux?
- Enterprise Linux (product) having SLO and SLA, which required for business.
- Linux is a community productcoming under (OpenSource), community not having any SLO and SLA.
- OpenSource mean - SOftware and source code must be available for all and for any purpose.

Many Linux distributions:-
 - RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) - Enterprise Linux     
 - CentOS 
 - Fedora 
 - Ubuntu 
 - Open SUSE 
 - Enterprise SUSE     - Enterprise Linux 
 - Kali Linux 
 
What is UNIX Vs Linux ? Due to GNU projecy (GNU NOT UNIX project - To create UNIX type OS.).
Linux OS = UNIX utility + Linux krernel 

######### 
1) Users
2) Shell - Interface (GUI & CLI).
3) Kernel 
4) Hardware (IBM blade server/Cisco servers etc 



1) Users (Administratier =root account, Each using havin User ID, root user's ID is 0)
2) Normal User (User created by root user for some work).
  NOte: Normal user can also have power same as root user having.
  
3) System users (apache, tcpdump etc):- When application deployed.


################

Absolute path  - It always start with "/".
Relative path  - It never start with "/".

Note: To get the absolute path - 
$ which pwd
/usr/bin/pwd 

Same also available here.
/bin/pwd 


########
## The file system Hierarchy 

Level 1st Directory hierarchy:-
"/"   - root directory 

Level 2nd directory hierarchy:-
"bin"  (Absolute location - /bin ) - ALl normal user's executable are placed inside "/bin" - Those are called command.
"boot" (Absolute location - /boot) - All booting related files and dir here.
"dev"  (Absolute location - /dev - All device files must be available at "dev" dir. 
"etc"  (Absolute location - /etc  - THe main configuration file here.
"home" (Absolute location - /home - ALl defauls user's home directory must be here.
"root" (Absolute location - /root - root user's home directory must be here.
"run"  (Absolute location - /run  - ALl run time data placed in "/run", it's temp).
"sbin" (Absolute location - /sbin ) - ALl normal root/sudo user's executable are placed inside "/sbin" - Those are called command.
"tmp"  (Absolute location - /tmp ) - ALl temp files/dir created here.

        NOte: If /tmp used almost 100% then any appliaction running and referencing "/tmp" will not work.
"usr"  (Absolute location - /usr) - This directory for easy customization.
       Eg:- /usr/local/bin/myscript
	        /usr/bin/tree
			/usr/sbin/useradd
"var"  -( Absolute location /v arr)   "Variable data (/var)".

Installation of OS (CentOS 7.9)

Step-01 ) DOwnload Oracle virtual box (3rd party software - same as hypervisor which allow to create virtual machine).
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Step-02) DOwnload CentOS 7.9 images.
http://centos.excellmedia.net/7.9.2009/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-2009.iso
  
Step-03) Once download completed then open your "Oracle virtual Box Manager".
Once "Oracle virtual Box Manager" started --> Click on new  --> Name of the virtual machine "server-01/02"  --> "Name and operating system" - Input from your side (Linux and x86_64 "version64-bits") then click on "Next" --> provide RAM "3076" inside box - 3076, Select "Create Virtual Disk now" --> VHD (Viryal Hard Disk) and click on "Next".
Storage 25Gb and click on "create" 

then start your virtual machine and follow the installation step.
