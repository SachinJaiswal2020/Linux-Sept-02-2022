### Concepts - Installation of EL on system (Physical/Virtual)
  
Physical machine - Laptop/Dell-PowerEdge servers/ HP GEN X / IBM Power/SOme model Blade server/etc.
Virtual Machine  - Virtual machines serve same applications as physical machines.
NOte: ***
 - Virtual machine installed on hypervisor (Hypervisor - It's OS which allow to create Virtual machine).
 - Those virtual machine having guest operating systems, later DB or middleware installed on OS and run the application.
 - Hypervisor (3rd part based software) - which allow to create VIrtual machine.
 - Hypervisor used here is - "Oracle Virtual Box" ( INstalled this on your system).
 - We have used CentOS 7.9 with x86_64 arch and build the OS, Also we have mounted the same ISO on your system.
 - We have used GNOME (GUI interface) and bash (CLI Interface).
 
 - Commands 
 - User & Group management:-
   
  #Users:-
   Create user - useradd 
   Delete user - userdel 
   Modify user - usermod
   
   useradd <user_name> 
   Eg:
   useradd john 
   useradd tom 
   
   
  #Groups:-
   Create group - groupadd 
   Delete group - groupdel 
   modify group - groupmod   
   
  #groupadd <group_name>
	Eg:
	  groupadd unix_team
 
  #passwd (Set password for users).
   passwd <user_name>(as root user).
   passwd john 
   Type:
   retype:
   
   group = unix_team
   useradd -g <primary_group_name> <user_name>
   Eg:
     useradd -g unix_team john  (unix_team is a primary group of john)
	 usermod -G unix_team tom   (unix_team is a secoundry group of yom)
   
   

LAB-01
Create groups:-
unix_adm 
db_adm
devops 
app1
app2 

   
  - Create user = user1 to user5  (belongs to unix_adm)
  - Create user = user11 to user15  (belongs to db_adm)
  - Create user = user16 to user20  (belongs to devops)
  - Create user = user21 to user30  (belongs to app1)
  - Create user = user31 to user40  (belongs to app2)
 
 
   - pAssword for all users is "redhat"
 
 =================================================
 groupadd project 
 Assign "project" group to all users (user1 to 40)
 usermod -G project user1 
 usermod -G project user2 
 
 So that user1 will be a part of unix_adm & project.
 
 
 mkdir /Project 
 cd /Project 
 mkdir UNIX DB DEVOPS APP1 APP2 
 chmod 770 /Project 
 chmod 770 UNIX
 chmod 770 DB
 chmod 770 DEVOPS
 chmod 770 APP1
 chmod 770 APP2
 
 pwd
 /Project 
 chown root:unix_adm UNIX 
 chown root:db_adm DB 
 chown root:devops DEVOPS
 chown root:app1 APP1
 chown root:app2 APP2
 
 
 Example:- 
 echo "redhat | passwd --stdin user_name
 echo "redhat | passwd --stdin user1 
 
 ===========
 - NOw only those users part of "project" group can only access "/Project"
 - And everyone can do work on their project only.
